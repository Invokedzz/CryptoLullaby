# CryptoLullaby

API developed to deepen knowledge in security using Keycloak and cloud storage.

## Tech Stack

**Back-end:** Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Spring Cloud, Spring Security, RabbitMQ, Docker, Keycloak, Postman, Maven.


## Features

- Cloud image storage using Cloudinary;

- Paginated API responses;

- Creation and editing of accounts, posts, comments, etc.;

- Integration with external APIs to generate dashboards and charts related to cryptocurrencies;

- Messaging system for sending emails;

- Keycloak for user management and authentication.



## Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was orchestrating communication between microservices using RabbitMQ, which gave me a much better understanding of asynchronous messaging and scalability. Working with authentication and authorization through Keycloak also pushed me to dive deeper into API security best practices.
